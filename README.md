Cyber Security Base - Course Project I

This project is a simple web application (built using Spring) that contains multiple security vulnerabilities present in
the top 10 most common web vulnerabilities list provided by OWASP.

#  A5:2017- Broken Access Control
Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access
other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.

# A7:2017- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without
proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a
browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the
victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to
malicious sites.

# A10:2017- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident
response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems,
and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over
200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring.
